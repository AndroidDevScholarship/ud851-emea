This is a test!

We are hard working **students** from the **Google/Udacity EMEA 2018 scholarship**. 

As we are extremely proud on a personal level of what we've accomplished during these 9 months and how we got to grow as Android and web developers, we thought it would be nice to showcase some of our work here, for other scholarship students and the rest of the world to see.

We hope you enjoy the show!

*Thank you*
